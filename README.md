# Bash Tic-Tac-Toe

An attempt to expand my Bash powers during the PLIBMTTBHGATY event of [!!Con 2022](https://bangbangcon.com/)

## To start

In a Bash shell, type
```bash
source tictac.sh
```

## To play

Type the letter of the grid position you choose.

The computer will select its position using a complex algorithm (read: randomly).

The game ends when either player controls three boxes in a row. If there are no remaining boxes, the game ends in a draw.


> ### Tip
> Against this extremely silly opponent, winning is easy. For a real challenge, try losing!
